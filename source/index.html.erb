        <p>This will contain a piece of text about me, what inspires me, what makes me happy, hippy shit for sure, since webpeoples like liberal and leftwinged stuff, oh and let us not forget the environment and polution. For the rest I do startup stuff. Created a small social media app, which flucked hard, to bad but I did learn many lessons. So basically I'm going around town helping others face the same difficulties I have come across and help them with that. Oh and basically I have a web prodeuct idea every week, some better than others, but hey I like it. And also, this text will need to be a certain length otherwise it will not look cool on the page so that is why im filling this page until the design looks awesome AF.
